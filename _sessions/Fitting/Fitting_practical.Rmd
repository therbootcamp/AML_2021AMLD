## Overview

In this practical, you'll practice the basics of fitting and exploring regression models in R using the `tidymodels` package.

By the end of this practical you will know how to:

1. Fit a regression model to training data.
2. Explore your fit object with generic functions.
3. Evaluate the model's fitting performance using accuracy measures such as RMSE and MAE.
4. Explore the effects of adding additional features.


## Tasks

### A - Setup

1. Open your `RBootcamp_AMLD2021` R project. It should already have the folders `1_Data` and `2_Code`. Make sure that the data file(s) listed in the `Datasets` section are in your `1_Data` folder

```{r}
# Done!
```

2. Open a new R script and save it as a new file called `Fitting_practical.R` in the `2_Code` folder.  

```{r}
# Done!
```

3. Using `library()` load the set of packages for this practical listed in the packages section above.

```{r, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
# Load packages necessary for this script
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
tidymodels_prefer() # to resolve common conflicts
```

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
# Load packages necessary for this practical
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
tidymodels_prefer() # to resolve common conflicts
```

4. For this practical, we'll use a dataset of airbnbs in Berlin. The data is stored in `airbnb.csv`. Using the following template, load the dataset into R as `airbnb`:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Load in airbnb.csv data as airbnb
airbnb <- read_csv(file = "1_Data/airbnb.csv")
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
airbnb <- read_csv(file = "1_Data/airbnb.csv")
```

5. Take a look at the first few rows of the dataset by printing it to the console.

```{r}
airbnb
```

6. Print the numbers of rows and columns using the `dim()` function.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Print number of rows and columns of airbnb
dim(XXX)
```

```{r}
# Print number of rows and columns of airbnb
dim(airbnb)
```

7. Open the dataset in a new window using `View()`. How does it look?

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
View(XXX)
```

8. Familiarize yourself with the names of the dataset by looking at the feature names using `names()`.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Print column names of airbnb
names(XXX)
```

```{r}
# Print column names of airbnb
names(airbnb)
```

9. Before starting to model the data, we need to do a little bit of data cleaning. Given the names of the data and the description in the *Datasets* tab, which do you think could be excluded?

```{r}
# apartment_id and host_id do not contain information that will help in the modeling
# process, as they provide (almost) unique identifiers for a given apartment and
# thus don't contain generalizable information.
# longitude and latitude are already more or less covered in the "neighbourhood"
# and "district" variables.
```

10. Let's remove the variables we won't need in the analyses. Also, the `cleening_fee` is currently a string, because of the \$ sign in front of the numbers. Let's change this to create a numeric variable. 

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Convert character to factor
airbnb <- 
  airbnb %>%
  select(-ends_with(c("_id", "itude"))) %>% 
  mutate(cleaning_fee = as.numeric(gsub("$", "", cleaning_fee, fixed = TRUE)))
```

### B - Set up the model

1. In this practical we will use a linear regression to predict the price of airbnbs. To be able to do so in `tidymodels`, we first have to set up our model. We do this by specifying (a) the model type, (b) the enginge we want to use, and (c) whether we are working on a regression or a classification problem. To do so, ...

- set the model type to `linear_reg()`.
- specify the engine using `set_engine(XXX)`, with the engine `"lm"`.
- specify, that the problem type with `set_mode(XXX)` to `"regression"`.
- add all these function calls together using the `%>%` operator.
- save the model specification as `lm_model`.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# set up our model
lm_model <- 
  XXX() %>% 
  XXX(XXX) %>% 
  XXX(XXX)
```

```{r}
# set up our model
lm_model <- 
  linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("lm") %>% 
  set_mode("regression")
```

2. Take a look at your model by printing `lm_model`.

```{r}
# print lm_model
lm_model
```

3. Using `translate()` we can view the function that will be called to fit our model. Arguments not yet specified (and thus, at this point, unknown), will be shown as `missing_arg()`. Use `translate()` and pass `lm_model` as argument.

```{r}
# view the underlying function used to fit the model
translate(lm_model)
```

### C - Set up the recipe

1. In the previous section, we defined what model to fit. By specifying a `recipe`, we specify (a) what to predict, (b) how to predict it (the features), (c) how to prepare our data. Create your first recipe called `airbnb_recipe`, by adding a formula to specify that we want to predict `price` with the number of people it can accommodate (`accommodates`):

- set the formula to `price ~ accommodates`
- set the data to `airbnb`

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# create basic recipe
airbnb_recipe <- recipe(XXX ~ XXX, data = XXX)
```

```{r}
# create basic recipe
airbnb_recipe <- recipe(price ~ accommodates, data = airbnb)
```

2. Print the created recipe.

```{r}
airbnb_recipe
```


### D - Fit a regression model

1. Now we can finally specify our model `workflow` in which we bring the model specification and recipe together, to then fit our model. To do so

- create an object called `lm_workflow`.
- call the `workflow()` function, to initiate the workflow.
- add the `airbnb_recipe` using the `add_recipe()` function.
- add the `lm_model` model specification using the `add_model()` function.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# lm workflow 
lm_workflow <- 
  XXX() %>% 
  XXX(XXX) %>% 
  XXX(XXX)
```

```{r}
# lm workflow 
lm_workflow <- 
  workflow() %>% 
  add_recipe(airbnb_recipe) %>% 
  add_model(lm_model)
```

2. Print the `lm_workflow` object to view a summary of how the modeling will be done.

```{r}
lm_workflow
```

3. Now it's time to actually fit the model with the `fit()` function. Pass the `lm_workflow` into the fit function and save it as `price_lm`. Also we have to provide the data to the fit function, by specifying the `data` argument. Set `data = airbnb`.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Fit the regression model
price_lm <-
  XXX %>% 
  XXX(XXX = XXX)
```

```{r}
# Fit the regression model
price_lm <-
  lm_workflow %>% 
  fit(airbnb)
```

4. Print the `price_lm` object.

```{r}
price_lm
```

5. While this showed us the two parameters, the output is not very informative. To obtain a more detailed output, you can use the `tidy()` function on the `price_lm` object.


```{r}
# Fit the regression model
tidy(price_lm)
```

6. Take a look at the parameter values. How do you interpret these values?

```{r}
# For every additional person a flat accommodates, the price of an airbnb is
# predicted to rise by 18$s.
```



### E - Evaluate accuracy

1. Now it's time to evaluate the model's fitted values! Use the `predict()` function to extract the model predictions. This returns them as a column named `.pred`. Then, using `bind_cols()` add the true values.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# generate predictions
lm_pred <-
  XXX %>% 
  predict(new_data = airbnb) %>% 
  bind_cols(airbnb %>% select(price))
```

```{r}
# generate predictions
lm_pred <-
  price_lm %>% 
  predict(new_data = airbnb) %>% 
  bind_cols(airbnb %>% select(price))
```

2. Take a look at the `lm_pred` object and make sure you understand the meaning of these variables.

```{r}
# The first variable, .pred,  was created in the call to the predict() function. 
# It contains the predicted prices. The second variable, price, contains the 
# actual prices from our dataset.
```


3. Using the following code, plot the fitted against the true value, to judge how well our model performed. What do you think, is this performance good or bad?

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# use the lm_pred object to generate the plot
ggplot(lm_pred, aes(x = .pred, y = price)) + 
  # Create a diagonal line:
  geom_abline(lty = 2) + 
  # Add data points:
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(title = "Regression: One Feature",
       subtitle = "Line indicates perfect performance",
       x = "Predicted Airbnb Prices in $",
       y = "True Airbnb Prices in $") +
  # Scale and size the x- and y-axis uniformly:
  coord_obs_pred()
```

```{r}
# The points do not fall on the line, which indicates
# a poor model fit.
```

4. Let's quantify our model's fitting results. In a regression-problem setting, the `metrics()` function returns the MAE, RMSE, and the $R^2$ of a model. Compute these indices by passing the `price` variable as `truth` and the `.pred` variable as `estimate` to the `metrics()` function.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# evaluate performance
XXX(lm_pred, truth = XXX, estimate = XXX)
```

```{r}
# evaluate performance
metrics(lm_pred, truth = price, estimate = .pred)
```

5. How do you interpret these values?

```{r}
# On average, the model commits a prediction error of 34.9 when predicting the 
# price of an airbnb. The large difference between the MAE and the RMSE indicates
# That the prediction errors vary very strongly. This is also apparent in the 
# plot we created before.
# The R^2 value is 0.0458, that is, only about 5% of the variation in the data
# can be captured by our model.
```

### F - Add more features

So far we have only used one feature (`accommodates`), to predict `price`. Let's try again, but now we'll use a total of four features: 

- `accommodates` - the number of people the airbnb accommodates.
- `room_type`` - type of the room (e.g., "Loft" or "Apartment").
- `bedrooms` - number of bedrooms.
- `bathrooms` - number of bathrooms.

1. To do this, we will have to update our `lm_recipe`. Specifically, we want to add the three new features to the formula, and add a pre-processing step: creating dummy variables out of the categorical `room_type` variable. Update the recipe from C1, by extending the formula, and by adding `step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors())` as pre-processing step.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# updated recipe
airbnb_recipe <- 
  recipe(XXX ~ XXX + XXX + XXX + XXX, data = XXX) %>% 
  XXX(XXX())
```

```{r}
# updated recipe
airbnb_recipe <- 
  recipe(price ~ accommodates + room_type + bedrooms + bathrooms,
                        data = airbnb) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors())
```

2. Update the recipe in the workflow using the `update_recipe()` function. Pass the new `airbnb_recipe` to `update_recipe()`.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# update lm workflow with new recipe
lm_workflow <- 
  lm_workflow 
  XXX(XXX) %>% 
```

```{r}
# update lm workflow with new recipe
lm_workflow <- 
  lm_workflow %>% 
  update_recipe(airbnb_recipe)
```

3. Print the `lm_workflow` object to view a summary of how the modeling will be done. The recipe should now be updated, which you can see by the new section *Preprocessor*.

```{r}
lm_workflow
```

3. Refit the model as you have done above, and call it `price_lm`.

```{r}
# Fit the regression model
price_lm <-
  lm_workflow %>% 
  fit(airbnb)
```

4. Using the `tidy()` function on the `price_lm` object, take a look at the parameter estimates.


```{r}
# Fit the regression model
tidy(price_lm)
```

5. Using the `predict()` function, to extract the model predictions and bind them together with the true values using `bind_cols()`.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# generate predictions
lm_pred <-
  XXX %>% 
  XXX(XXX) %>% 
  XXX(airbnb %>% select(price))
```

```{r}
# generate predictions
lm_pred <-
  price_lm %>% 
  predict(new_data = airbnb) %>% 
  bind_cols(airbnb %>% select(price))
```


6. Using the following code, plot the fitted against the true value, to judge how well our model performed. What do you think, is this performance good or bad? And how does it compare to the model with only one feature we fitted before?

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# use the lm_pred object to generate the plot
ggplot(lm_pred, aes(x = .pred, y = price)) + 
  # Create a diagonal line:
  geom_abline(lty = 2) + 
  # Add data points:
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(title = "Regression: One Feature",
       subtitle = "Line indicates perfect performance",
       x = "Predicted Airbnb Prices in $",
       y = "True Airbnb Prices in $") +
  # Scale and size the x- and y-axis uniformly:
  coord_obs_pred()
```

```{r}
# The model seems to do a little better than before, but the points still do not
# really fall on the line, which indicates a poor model fit.
```

7. Using the `metrics()` function, evaluate the model performance. Pass it the `price` variable as `truth` and the `.pred` variable as `estimate`.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# evaluate performance
XXX(lm_pred, truth = XXX, estimate = XXX)
```

```{r}
# evaluate performance
metrics(lm_pred, truth = price, estimate = .pred)

```

8. How do you interpret these values? How do they compare to the ones you obtained previously?

```{r}
# On average, the model commits a prediction error of 35.7 when predicting the 
# price of an airbnb. This is even larger than with only the one predictor.
# The large difference between the MAE and the RMSE indicates
# that the prediction errors vary very strongly. This is also apparent in the 
# plot we created before.
# The R^2 value is 0.124, that is, about 12% of the variation in the data
# can be captured by our model, which is more than twice of what the model with
# only one feature explained.
```


### G - Use all features

Alright, now it's time to use all features available!

1. Update the formula of the `lm_recipe` and set it to `price ~ .` The `.` indicates that all available variables that are not outcomes should be used as features.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# updated recipe
airbnb_recipe <- 
  recipe(XXX ~ XXX, data = XXX) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors())
```

```{r}
# updated recipe
airbnb_recipe <- 
  recipe(price ~ ., data = airbnb) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors())
```


2. Update the recipe in the workflow using the `update_recipe()` function. Pass the new `airbnb_recipe` to `update_recipe()`.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# update lm workflow with new recipe
lm_workflow <- 
  lm_workflow 
  XXX(XXX) %>% 
```

```{r}
# update lm workflow with new recipe
lm_workflow <- 
  lm_workflow %>% 
  update_recipe(airbnb_recipe)
```

3. Refit the model as you have done above, and call it `price_lm`.

```{r}
# Fit the regression model
price_lm <-
  lm_workflow %>% 
  fit(airbnb)
```

4. Using the `tidy()` function on the `price_lm` object, take a look at the parameter estimates.


```{r}
# Fit the regression model
tidy(price_lm)
```

5. Using the `predict()` function, to extract the model predictions and bind them together with the true values using `bind_cols()`.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# generate predictions
lm_pred <-
  XXX %>% 
  XXX(XXX) %>% 
  XXX(airbnb %>% select(price))
```

```{r}
# generate predictions
lm_pred <-
  price_lm %>% 
  predict(new_data = airbnb) %>% 
  bind_cols(airbnb %>% select(price))
```


6. Using the following code, plot the fitted against the true value, to judge how well our model performed. What do you think, is this performance good or bad? And how does it compare to the model with only one feature we fitted before?

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# use the lm_pred object to generate the plot
ggplot(lm_pred, aes(x = .pred, y = price)) + 
  # Create a diagonal line:
  geom_abline(lty = 2) + 
  # Add data points:
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(title = "Regression: One Feature",
       subtitle = "Line indicates perfect performance",
       x = "Predicted Airbnb Prices in $",
       y = "True Airbnb Prices in $") +
  # Scale and size the x- and y-axis uniformly:
  coord_obs_pred()
```

```{r}
# Even with all predictors, the model seems to have some issues.
```

7. Using the `metrics` function, evaluate the model performance. Pass it the `price` variable as `truth` and the `.pred` variable as `estimate`.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# evaluate performance
XXX(lm_pred, truth = XXX, estimate = XXX)
```

```{r}
# evaluate performance
metrics(lm_pred, truth = price, estimate = .pred)

```

8. How do you interpret these values? How do they compare to the ones you obtained previously?

```{r}
# On average, the model commits a prediction error of 37.9 when predicting the 
# price of an airbnb. This is again larger than with only the one predictor.
# The large difference between the MAE and the RMSE indicates
# that the prediction errors vary very strongly. This is also apparent in the 
# plot we created before.
# The R^2 value is 0.196, that is, about 20% of the variation in the data
# can be captured by our model.
```

### Classification

### H - Make sure your criterion is a factor!

Now it's time to do a classification task! Recall that in a classification task, we are predicting a category, not a continuous number. In this task, we'll predict whether or not a host is a superhost (these are experienced hosts that meet a [set of criteria](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/829/how-do-i-become-a-superhost?_set_bev_on_new_domain=1629269796_MjI5MzcwYTI5MDVm&locale=en)). Whether or not a host is a superhost is stored in the variable `host_superhost`.

1. In order to do classification training, we have to ensure that the criterion is coded as a `factor`. To test whether it is coded as a factor, you can look at its `class` as follows.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Look at the class of the variable host_superhost, should be a factor!
class(airbnb$host_superhost)
```

2. The `host_superhost` variable is of class `logical`. Therefore, we have to change it to `factor`. **Important note**: In binary classification tasks, the **first** factor level will be chosen as positive. We therefore explicitly specify, that `TRUE` be the first level.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Define criterion as college_train$Private
airbnb <-
  airbnb %>% 
  mutate(host_superhost = factor(host_superhost, levels = c(TRUE, FALSE)))
```

3. Check again, whether `host_superhost` is now a factor, and check whether the order of the levels is as intended using `levels()` (the order should be `"TRUE", "FALSE"`).

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
XXX(airbnb$host_superhost)
XXX(airbnb$host_superhost)
```

```{r}
class(airbnb$host_superhost)
levels(airbnb$host_superhost)

```

### I - Fit a classification model

1. Given that we now want to predict a new variable (`host_superhost`) with a new model (a logistic regression), we need to update both our model and our recipe. Create a new model called `logistic_model`, with the model type `logistic_reg`, the engine `"glm"`, and mode `"classification"`.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# create a logistic regression model 
XXX_model <-
  XXX() %>% 
  set_XXX(XXX) %>% 
  set_XXX(XXX)
```


```{r}
# create a logistic regression model 
logistic_model <-
  logistic_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("glm") %>% 
  set_mode("classification")
```

2. Print the `logistic_model` object. Using `translate()`, check out the underlying function that will be used to fit the model.

```{r}
logistic_model
translate(logistic_model)
```

3. Specify the new recipe. Specifically...

- set the formula to `host_superhost ~ .`, to use all possible features
- add `step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors())` to pre-process nominal features
- call the new object `logistic_recipe`


```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# create new recipe
XXX <- 
  XXX(XXX, data = XXX) %>% 
  XXX(XXX())
```

```{r}
# create new recipe
logistic_recipe <- 
  recipe(host_superhost ~ ., data = airbnb) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors())
```

4. Print the new recipe.

```{r}
logistic_recipe
```

5. Create a new workflow called `logistic_workflow`, where you add the `logistic_model` and the `logistic_recipe` together.

```{r}
# create logistic_workflow 
logistic_workflow <- 
  workflow() %>% 
  add_recipe(logistic_recipe) %>% 
  add_model(logistic_model)
```

5. Print and check out the new workflow.

```{r}
logistic_workflow
```

6. Fit the model using `fit()`. Save the result as 

```{r}
# Fit the logistic regression model
superhost_glm <-
  logistic_workflow %>% 
  fit(airbnb)
```


### J - Assess model performance

1. Now it's time to evaluate the classification models' performance. We can again use the `metrics()` function to do so. First, we again create a dataset containing the predicted and true values. This time, we call the `predict()` function twice: once to obtain the predicted classes, and once to obtain the probabilities, with which the classes are predicted.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Get fitted values from the Private_glm object
logistic_pred <- 
  predict(superhost_glm, airbnb, type = "prob") %>% 
  bind_cols(predict(superhost_glm, airbnb)) %>% 
  bind_cols(airbnb %>% select(host_superhost))
```

```{r}
# Get fitted values from the Private_glm object
logistic_pred <- 
  predict(superhost_glm, airbnb, type = "prob") %>% 
  bind_cols(predict(superhost_glm, airbnb)) %>% 
  bind_cols(airbnb %>% select(host_superhost))
```

2. Take a look at the `logistic_pred` object and make sure you understand what the variables mean.

```{r}
# The first two variables contain the predicted class probabilities and were
# created from the first call to predict(), where type = "prob" was used.
# The third variable, .pred_class, contains the predicted class. If the .pred_TRUE
# variable in a given row was >=.5, this will be TRUE, otherwise it will be FALSE.
# Finally, the last variable, host_superhost, contains the true values.
```


3. Now, get the confusion matrix using the `conf_mat()` function and passing it the `host_superhost` variable as `truth`, and th `.pred_class` variable as `estimate`. Just by looking at the confusion matrix, do you think the model is doing well?

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
XXX(logistic_pred, truth = XXX, estimate = XXX)
```

```{r}
conf_mat(logistic_pred, truth = host_superhost, estimate = .pred_class)
```

4. Let's look at different performance metrics. Use the `metrics()` function, with exactly the same arguments as you used in the call to `conf_mat()` before, to obtain the accuracy and the kappa statistic (a chance-corrected measure of agreement between model prediction and true value).

```{r}
metrics(logistic_pred, truth = host_superhost, estimate = .pred_class)
```

5. How do you interpret these values? Do you think the model performs well?

```{r}
logistic_pred %>% 
  pull(host_superhost) %>% 
  table() %>% 
  prop.table() %>% 
  round(2)
# Just by predicting always FALSE, the model could reach an accuracy of 68%.
# By using all the features available, the model can do about 10 percentage points
# better than that. According to some, completely arbitrary, guidelines, the 
# kappa value of .48 can be considered moderate or fair to good.
# Whether such values are acceptable depends on the use case.
```

6. The metrics we just looked at are based on the class predictions. We can also obtain additional metrics based on the predicted probabilities of class membership. Use the same code as in the last task, but add the name of the column containing the predictied *positive* class probability (`.pred_TRUE`) as an unnamed, fourth argument:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
XXX(logistic_pred, truth = XXX, estimate = XXX, XXX)
```

```{r}
metrics(logistic_pred, truth = host_superhost, estimate = .pred_class, .pred_TRUE)
```

7. What does the `roc_auc` value indicate?

```{r}
# It indicates the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator
# characteristic (ROC) curve. A value of 1 would be perfect, indicating that both 
# sensitivity and specificity simultaneously take perfect values.
```

8. To plot the ROC curve, we can use the `roc_curve()` function, to create sensitivity and specificity values of different cut-offs, and pass this into the `autoplot()` function, to plot the curve. Add the `host_superhost` column as `truth`, and the `.pred_TRUE` column as third, unnamed argument, to the `roc_curve()` function and plot the curve.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
XXX(logistic_pred, truth = XXX, XXX) %>% 
  autoplot()
```

```{r}
roc_curve(logistic_pred, truth = host_superhost, .pred_TRUE) %>% 
  autoplot()
```

## Examples

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Fitting and evaluating a regression model ------------------------------------

# Step 0: Load packages---------------------------------------------------------
library(tidyverse)    # Load tidyverse for dplyr and tidyr
library(tidymodels)   # For ML mastery 
tidymodels_prefer()   # To resolve common conflicts

# Step 1: Load and Clean, and Explore Training data ----------------------------

# I'll use the mpg dataset from the dplyr package in this example
#  no need to load an external dataset
data_train <- read_csv("1_Data/mpg_train.csv")

# Explore training data
data_train        # Print the dataset
View(data_train)  # Open in a new spreadsheet-like window 
dim(data_train)   # Print dimensions
names(data_train) # Print the names

# Step 2: Define model ---------------------------------------------------------

# The model definition defines what kind of model we want to use and how to
# fit it
lm_model <- 
  linear_reg() %>%        # Specify model type
  set_engine("lm") %>%    # Specify engine (often package name) to use
  set_mode("regression")  # Specify whether it's a regressio or classification
                          #  problem.

# Step 3: Define recipe --------------------------------------------------------

# The recipe defines what to predict with what, and how to pre-process the data
lm_recipe <- 
  recipe(hwy ~ year + cyl + displ + trans,  # Specify formula
         data = data_train) %>%             # Specify the data
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors())      # Dummy code all categorical predictors

# Step 4: Define workflow ------------------------------------------------------

# The workflow combines model and recipe, so that we can fit the model
lm_workflow <- 
  workflow() %>%             # Initialize workflow
  add_model(lm_model) %>%    # Add the model to the workflow
  add_recipe(lm_recipe)      # Add the recipe to the workflow

# Step 5: Fit the model --------------------------------------------------------

hwy_lm <- 
  lm_workflow %>%   # Use the specified workflow
  fit(data_train)   # Fit the model on the specified data

tidy(hwy_lm)        # Look at summary information

# Step 6: Assess fit -----------------------------------------------------------

# Save model predictions and observed values
lm_fitted <- 
  hwy_lm %>%               # Model from which to extract predictions
  predict(data_train) %>%  # Obtain predictions, based on entered data (in this
                           #  case, these predictions are not out-of-sample)
  bind_cols(data_train %>% select(hwy))  # Extract observed/true values

# Obtain performance metrics
metrics(lm_fitted, truth = hwy, estimate = .pred)


# Step 7: Visualize Accuracy ---------------------------------------------------

# use the lm_fitted object to generate the plot
ggplot(lm_fitted, aes(x = .pred, y = hwy)) + 
  # Create a diagonal line:
  geom_abline(lty = 2) + 
  # Add data points:
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(title = "Regression: Four Features",
       subtitle = "Line indicates perfect performance",
       x = "Predicted hwy",
       y = "True hwy") +
  # Scale and size the x- and y-axis uniformly:
  coord_obs_pred()
```
