## Overview

By the end of this practical you will know how to:

1. Use cross-validation to select optimal model tuning parameters for decision trees and random forests.
2. Compare 'standard' regression with lasso and ridge penalised regression.
3. Use cross-validation to estimate future test accuracy.

## Tasks

In this practical, we will predict the `Salary` of baseball players from the `hitters_train` and `hitters_test` datasets. 

### A - Setup

1. Open your `RBootcamp_AMLD2020` R project. It should already have the folders `1_Data` and `2_Code`. Make sure that the data file(s) listed in the `Datasets` section are in your `1_Data` folder

2. Open a new R script and save it as a new file called `Optimization_practical.R` in the `2_Code` folder.  

3. Using `library()` load the set of packages for this practical listed in the packages section above.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
# Load packages necessary for this script
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
library(party)
library(partykit)
```

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
library(party)
library(partykit)
```

4. Run the code below to load each of the datasets listed in the `Datasets` section as new objects.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# hitters data
hitters_train <- read_csv(file = "1_Data/hitters_train.csv")
hitters_test <- read_csv(file = "1_Data/hitters_test.csv")
```

5. Take a look at the first few rows of each dataframe by printing them to the console.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Print dataframes to the console
hitters_train
hitters_test
```


6. Open each dataset in a new window using `View()`. Do they look ok?

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Open each dataset in a window.
View(XXX)
View(XXX)
```

7. As always, we need to convert all character columns to factors before we start. Do this by running the following code.

```{r}
# Convert all character columns to factor
hitters_train <- hitters_train %>%
          mutate_if(is.character, factor)

hitters_test <- hitters_test %>%
          mutate_if(is.character, factor)
```

### B - Setup `trainControl()`

1. Set up your training by specifying `ctrl_cv` as 10-fold cross-validation. Specifically,...

- set `method = "cv"` to specify cross validation.
- set `number = 10` to specify 10 folds.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Use 10-fold cross validation
ctrl_cv <- trainControl(method = "XX", 
                        number = XX) 
```

```{r}
# Use 10-fold cross validation
ctrl_cv <- trainControl(method = "cv", 
                        number = 10) 
```

### C - Regression (standard)

1. Fit a (standard) regression model predicting `Salary` as a function of all features. Specifically,...

- set the formula to `Salary ~ .`.
- set the data to `hitters_train`.
- set the method to `"glm"` for regular regression.
- set the train control argument to `ctrl_cv`.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Normal Regression --------------------------
salary_glm <- train(form = XX ~ .,
                    data = XX,
                    method = "XX",
                    trControl = XX)
```

```{r}
# Normal Regression --------------------------
salary_glm <- train(form = Salary ~ .,
                   data = hitters_train,
                   method = "glm",
                   trControl = ctrl_cv)
```

2. Print your `salary_glm`. What do you see?

```{r}
salary_glm
```

3. Print your final model object with `salary_glm$finalModel`.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Print final regression model
salary_glm$finalModel
```

4. Print your final regression model coefficients with `coef()`.

```{r}
# Print glm coefficients
coef(salary_glm$finalModel)
```

### D - Ridge Regression

It's time to fit an optimized regression model with a Ridge penalty!

1. Before we can fit a ridge regression model, we need to specify which values of the lambda penalty parameter we want to try. Using the code below, create a vector called `lambda_vec` which contains 100 values spanning a wide range, from very close to 0 to 1,000.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Vector of lambda values to try
lambda_vec <- 10 ^ (seq(-4, 4, length = 100))
```

2. Fit a ridge regression model predicting `Salary` as a function of all features. Specifically,...

- set the formula to `Salary ~ .`.
- set the data to `hitters_train`.
- set the method to `"glmnet"` for regularized regression.
- set the train control argument to `ctrl_cv`.
- set the `preProcess` argument to `c("center", "scale")` to make sure the variables are standarised when estimating the beta weights (this is good practice for ridge regression as otherwise the different scales of the variables impact the betas and thus the punishment would also depend on the scale).
- set the tuneGrid argument such that alpha is 0 (for ridge regression), and with all lambda values you specified in `lambda_vec` (we've done this for you below).

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Ridge Regression --------------------------
salary_ridge <- train(form = XX ~ .,
                      data = XX,
                      method = "XX",
                      trControl = XX,
                      preProcess = c("XX", "XX"),  # Standardise
                      tuneGrid = expand.grid(alpha = 0,  # Ridge penalty
                                             lambda = lambda_vec))
```

```{r}
# Ridge Regression --------------------------
salary_ridge <- train(form = Salary ~ .,
                      data = hitters_train,
                      method = "glmnet",
                      trControl = ctrl_cv,
                      preProcess = c("center", "scale"),  # Standardise
                      tuneGrid = expand.grid(alpha = 0,  # Ridge penalty
                                             lambda = lambda_vec))
```

3. Print your `salary_ridge` object. What do you see?

```{r}
salary_ridge
```

4. Plot your `salary_ridge` object. What do you see? Which value of the regularization parameter seems to be the best?

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Plot salary_ridge object
plot(XX)
```

```{r}
plot(salary_ridge)
```

5. Print the best value of lambda by running the following code. Does this match what you saw in the plot above?

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Print best regularisation parameter
salary_ridge$bestTune$lambda
```

6. What were your final regression model coefficients for the best lambda value? Find them by running the following code.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Get coefficients from best lambda value
coef(salary_ridge$finalModel, 
     salary_ridge$bestTune$lambda)
```

7. How do these coefficients compare to what you found in regular regression? Are they similar? Different?

```{r}
# Actually the look quite different! The reason why is that we have changed the scale using preProcess

# If you want the coefficients on the original scale, you'd need to convert them, or run your training again without any processing. However, this can lead to problems finding the optimal Lambda value...
```

### E - Lasso Regression

It's time to fit an optimized regression model with a Lasso penalty!

1. Before we can fit a lasso regression model, we again first specify which values of the lambda penalty parameter we want to try. Using the code below, create a vector called `lambda_vec` which contains 100 values between 0 and 1,000.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Determine possible values of lambda
lambda_vec <- 10 ^ seq(from = -4, to = 4, length = 100)
```

2. Fit a lasso regression model predicting `Salary` as a function of all features. Specifically,...

- set the formula to `Salary ~ .`.
- set the data to `hitters_train`.
- set the method to `"glmnet"` for regularized regression.
- set the train control argument to `ctrl_cv`.
- set the `preProcess` argument to `c("center", "scale")` to make sure the variables are standarised when estimating the beta weights (this is also good practice for lasso regression).
- set the tuneGrid argument such that alpha is 1 (for lasso regression), and with all lambda values you specified in `lambda_vec` (we've done this for you below).

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Lasso Regression --------------------------
salary_lasso <- train(form = XX ~ .,
                      data = XX,
                      method = "XX",
                      trControl = XX,
                      preProcess = c("XX", "XX"),  # Standardise
                      tuneGrid = expand.grid(alpha = 1,  # Lasso penalty
                                            lambda = lambda_vec))
```

```{r}
# Fit a lasso regression
salary_lasso <- train(form = Salary ~ .,
                   data = hitters_train,
                   method = "glmnet",
                   trControl = ctrl_cv,
                   preProcess = c("center", "scale"),
                   tuneGrid = expand.grid(alpha = 1,  # Lasso penalty
                                          lambda = lambda_vec))
```

3. Print your `salary_lasso` object. What do you see?

```{r}
salary_lasso
```


4. Plot your `salary_lasso` object. What do you see? Which value of the regularization parameter seems to be the best?

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Plot salary_lasso object
plot(XX)
```

```{r}
plot(salary_lasso)
```


5. Print the best value of lambda by running the following code. Does this match what you saw in the plot above?

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Print best regularisation parameter
salary_lasso$bestTune$lambda
```

6. What were your final regression model coefficients for the best lambda value? Find them by running the following code.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Get coefficients from best lambda value
coef(salary_lasso$finalModel, 
     salary_lasso$bestTune$lambda)
```

7. How do these coefficients compare to what you found in regular regression? Are they similar? Different? Do you notice that any coefficients are now set to exactly 0?

```{r}
# Yep!

# I see that many features are now removed!
```

### F - Decision Tree

It's time to fit an optimized decision tree model!

1. Before we can fit a decision tree, we need to specify which values of the complexity parameter `cp` we want to try. Using the code below, create a vector called `cp_vec` which contains 100 values between 0 and 1.

```{r}
# Determine possible values of the complexity parameter cp
cp_vec <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, length = 100)
```

2. Fit a decision tree model predicting `Salary` as a function of all features. Specifically,...

- set the formula to `Salary ~ .`.
- set the data to `hitters_train`.
- set the method to `"rpart"` for decision trees.
- set the train control argument to `ctrl_cv`,
- set the tuneGrid argument with all `cp` values you specified in `cp_vec`.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Decision Tree --------------------------
salary_rpart <- train(form = XX ~ .,
                  data = XX,
                  method = "XX",
                  trControl = XX,
                  tuneGrid = expand.grid(cp = cp_vec))
```

```{r}
# Decision Tree --------------------------
salary_rpart <- train(form = Salary ~ .,
                  data = hitters_train,
                  method = "rpart",
                  trControl = ctrl_cv,
                  tuneGrid = expand.grid(cp = cp_vec))
```

3. Print your `salary_rpart` object. What do you see?

```{r}
salary_rpart
```

4. Plot your `salary_rpart` object. What do you see? Which value of the complexity parameter seems to be the best?

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Plot salary_rpart object
plot(XX)
```

```{r}
plot(salary_rpart)
```

5. Print the best value of `cp` by running the following code. Does this match what you saw in the plot above?

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Print best regularisation parameter
salary_rpart$bestTune$cp
```

6. Plot your final decision tree using the following code:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Visualise your trees
plot(as.party(salary_rpart$finalModel)) 
```

7. How do the nodes in the tree compare to the coefficients you found in your regression analyses? Do you see similarities or differences?

```{r}
# Actually, the tree just has one root and no nodes! This is due to the optimal complexity parameter being so high.
```


### G - Random Forests

It's time to fit an optimized random forest model!

1. Before we can fit a random forest model, we need to specify which values of the diversity parameter `mtry` we want to try. Using the code below, create a vector called `mtry_vec` which is a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10.

```{r}
# Determine possible values of the random forest diversity parameter mtry
mtry_vec <- 1:10
```

2. Fit a random forest model predicting `Salary` as a function of all features. Specifically,...

- set the formula to `Salary ~ .`.
- set the data to `hitters_train`.
- set the method to `"rf"` for random forests.
- set the train control argument to `ctrl_cv`.
- set the tuneGrid argument such that mtry can take on the values you defined in `mtry_vec`.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Random Forest --------------------------
salary_rf <- train(form = XX ~ .,
                   data = XX,
                   method = "XX",
                   trControl = XX,
                   tuneGrid = expand.grid(mtry = mtry_vec))
```

```{r}
# Random Forest --------------------------
salary_rf <- train(form = Salary ~ .,
                   data = hitters_train,
                   method = "rf",
                   trControl = ctrl_cv,
                   tuneGrid = expand.grid(mtry = mtry_vec))
```

3. Print your `salary_rf` object. What do you see?

```{r}
salary_rf
```


4. Plot your `salary_rf` object. What do you see? Which value of the regularization parameter seems to be the best?

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Plot salary_rf object
plot(XX)
```

```{r}
plot(salary_rf)
```


5. Print the best value of `mtry` by running the following code. Does this match what you saw in the plot above?

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Print best mtry parameter
salary_rf$bestTune$mtry
```

### H - Estimate prediction accuracy from training folds

1. Using `resamples()`, calculate the estimated prediction accuracy for each of your models. To do this, put your model objects in the named list (e.g.; `glm = salary_glm`, ...). See below.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Summarise accuracy statistics across folds
salary_resamples <- resamples(list(glm = XXX,
                                   ridge = XXX, 
                                   lasso = XXX, 
                                   rpart = XXX, 
                                   rf = XXX))
```

```{r}
# Summarise accuracy statistics across folds
salary_resamples <- resamples(list(glm = salary_glm,
                                   ridge = salary_ridge, 
                                   lasso = salary_lasso, 
                                   dt = salary_rpart, 
                                   rf = salary_rf))
```

2. Look at the summary of your `salary_resamples` object with `summary(salary_resamples)`. What does this tell you? Which model do you expect to have the best prediction accuracy for the test data?

```{r}
# Print summaries of cross-validation accuracy 

# I see below that the random forest model has the lowest mean MAE, so I
#  would expect it to be the best model in the true test data
summary(salary_resamples)
```

### I - Calculate prediction accuracy

1. Save the criterion value for the test data as a new vector called `criterion_test`.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Save salaries of players in test dataset as criterion_test
criterion_test <- XXX$XXX
```

```{r}
criterion_test <- hitters_test$Salary
```

2. Using `predict()`, save the prediction of your regular regression model `salary_glm` for the `hitters_test` data as a new object called `glm_pred`. Specifically,...

- set the first argument to `salary_glm`.
- set the newdata argument to `hitters_test`.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Save the glm predicted salaries of hitters_test
glm_pred <- predict(XXX, newdata = XXX)
```


```{r}
# Save predictions for glm
glm_pred <- predict(salary_glm, newdata = hitters_test)
```

3. Now do the same with your ridge, lasso, decision tree, and random forest models to get the objects `ridge_pred`, `lasso_pred`, `rpart_pred` and `rf_pred`.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ridge_pred <- predict(XXX, newdata = XXX)
lasso_pred <- predict(XXX, newdata = XXX)
rpart_pred <- predict(XXX, newdata = XXX)
rf_pred <- predict(XXX, newdata = XXX)
```


```{r}
# Save predictions from other models
ridge_pred <- predict(salary_ridge, newdata = hitters_test)
lasso_pred <- predict(salary_lasso, newdata = hitters_test)
rpart_pred <- predict(salary_rpart, newdata = hitters_test)
rf_pred <- predict(salary_rf, newdata = hitters_test)
```

4. Using `postResample()`, calculate the aggregate prediction accuracy for each model using the template below. Specifically,...

- set the pred argument to your model predictions (e.g.; `ridge_pred`).
- set the `obs` argument to the true criterion values `criterion_test`).

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Calculate aggregate accuracy for a model
postResample(pred = XXX, 
             obs = XXX)
```

```{r}
# Prediction error for normal regression
postResample(pred = glm_pred, 
             obs = hitters_test$Salary)

# Prediction error for ridge regression
postResample(pred = ridge_pred, 
             obs = hitters_test$Salary)

# Prediction error for lasso regression
postResample(pred = lasso_pred, 
             obs = hitters_test$Salary)

# Prediction error for decision trees
postResample(pred = rpart_pred, 
             obs = hitters_test$Salary)

# Prediction error for random forests
postResample(pred = rf_pred, 
             obs = hitters_test$Salary)

```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
x <- postResample(pred = rf_pred, 
             obs = hitters_test$Salary)
```


5. Which of your models had the best performance in the true test data?

```{r}
# Random forests had the lowest test MAE of
postResample(pred = rf_pred, 
             obs = hitters_test$Salary)[3]
```


6. How close were your models' true prediction error to the values you estimated in the previous section when you ran `resamples()`?

```{r}
# Depends on what you mean by 'close', but they are definitely higher (worse) in the test data
```


## Examples

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Model optimization with Regression
